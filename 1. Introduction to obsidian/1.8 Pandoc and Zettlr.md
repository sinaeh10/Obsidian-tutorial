# Pandoc and Zettlr

Pandoc is a universal document converter and convert files, such as markdown and LaTeX, into Microsoft Word docx and PDFs. 

#### How to set up Pandoc
To use Pandoc, you must first install it for your system here: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

You can use pandoc for all of your files in the command-line tool (terminal in Mac, classic command prompt in Windows). You can read more on this here, although this is not necessary to know for the Obsidian tutorial: https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html

There is also a "Pandoc plugin" for Obsidian for converting an .md document into a word document with final citations from Zotero. However, the plugin does not currently generate a bibliography. The developers have announced that a bibliography feature will soon be added, but for now, we have figured out another solution: **Zettlr**.

#### How to set up Zettlr

Zettlr is a Zettelkasten note-taking program with markdown syntax, just like Obsidian. However, it does not have access to community plugins and there is currently no way to view linkages on a graph. But, unlike Obsidian, Zettlr can generate a bibliography from Zotero and can utilize pandoc to convert .md files to word documents. We use here Zettlr as a mediator between Obsidian and the final Microsoft Word .docx file.

Instructions on how to set up Zettlr:
1. Download Zettlr here: https://www.zettlr.com/
2. Open Zettlr and create a new workspace (a vault) that is separate from the Obsidian vault (to avoid syncing on top).
3. Copy-paste another copy of your Zotero .bib file (with same steps from [[1.7 Zotero]])
4. Open the Zettlr settings (wheel icon) and go to **Export**. Insert the path name of the .bib file into "Citation Database" and activate the internal Pandoc for exports.
5. Go to Advanced settings and add the path to pandoc executable. It should look something like this: /Users/username/opt/anaconda3/bin/pandoc

####  Converting an Obsidian note with Zettlr
1. Go to the local folder where your Obsidian notes are located. Copy a .md note and paste it into the workspace folder selected for Zettlr.
2. Open up Zettlr. You should now be able to see the document.
3. If you are using double-brackets [[]] around citations in Obsidian, be sure to remove the second bracket, so that there is only one. It should look like [@citekey]. From here, Zettlr will recognize these citations as part of the .bib file.
4. At the top of the window, there will be an icon for converting the document to a PDF or .docx Microsoft Word file ("Share the current file as HTML, DOCX, ODT, or PDF"). Select the .docx option.
5. You should now see your note as a Microsoft word document, with the citekey converted as an in-text citation (i.e. @citekey-> Author last, initial first. year) and a generated bibliography at the bottom.
6. There may be some formatting that you would like to do this (final font and colors in Word). These can be customized in Zettlr by viewing the template options here: https://docs.zettlr.com/en/academic/custom-templates/#hacking-your-templates. To customize, go to Settings->Advanced and add the variables to **Pandoc command**.
