# Appearance

You can also change the background theme if you want to opt for something more colorful, or easier to read. 

1. Click on "Appearance" in the settings menu. 
2. Go to Base Theme and select either light or dark theme.
3. Scroll down and find the browse option for "community themes".

#### Some other organization tips
You can add number bins and use the johnny decimal system for organizing folders and documents (the numbers bring the notes in order, as you cannot control the order in Obsidian currently). 
To read more about the Johnny decimal system, go [here](https://johnnydecimal.com/)

We break the rules a bit on this system, but we can recommend following a variation of it! It will force you to keep things organized. Here is an example:
