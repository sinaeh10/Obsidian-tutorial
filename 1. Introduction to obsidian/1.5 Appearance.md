# Appearance

Click on "Appearance" in the menu. 

1. Go to Base Theme and select either light or dark theme.
2. Scroll down and find the browse option for "community themes". Here you can preview and install various themes (dark and light) if you prefer different colors for the background. Some are more *fun* than others, but be sure to pick something that enables you to write well (i.e. someting that makes you feel as comfortable with Obsidian as you would with a Word document).

**Examples of our workspace:**

#### Some other organization tips
You can add number bins and use the johnny decimal system for organizing folders and documents (the numbers bring the notes in order, as you cannot control the order in Obsidian currently). 
To read more about the Johnny decimal system, go [here](https://johnnydecimal.com/)

We break the rules a bit on this system, but we can recommend following a variation of it! It will force you to keep things organized. Here is an example:
