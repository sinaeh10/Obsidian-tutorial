# Core plugins

#### Must-have settings
Let's customize the workspace a bit more! Click on the **settings** (wheel icon) on the bottom left and go into the "editor" menu first. Here, we recommend that you activate the following:
1. **Spell check**
2. **Auto-pair brackets**
3. **Auto-pair Markdown Syntax**


Now, go to "Files &Links" and activate the following:
1. Automatically update internal links -> this one is **important** to have. It updates your links in **all** notes automatically each time you change the link names.


#### Core plugins
 Click on the **settings** (wheel icon) on the bottom left and go into the "Core plugins"  menu. Here, we recommend that you activate the following core plugins:

1. **Tag pane** <- To have an overview of your tags inside the documents.
2. **Search** <- To search within your documents.
3.  Graph view <- To utilize the graph feature. For additional graph settings, check out [[1.6 Graph view]]
4.  Backlinks <- This will show you the other end of the links from the document that has been linked, so that you don't need to link it back.
5.  Outgoing links <- This shows a list of destinations your note links to. It also gives a list of unlinked mentions from the current note that can be linked.
6.  Page preview <- You will have a preview of the page when hovering over the link
7.  Templates <- You will be able to create note templates
8.  Outline <- When you make headers with # they appear on the outline. Great for navigating!
9.  Word count <- For keeping track of words written.
10.  Zettelkasten prefixer <-To generate a Zettelkasten prefixer for random note-taking
11.  Recordings <- To record a note with audio


When you feel ready, head over to [[3. Community plugins and snippets]] for downloading customized community plugins. This is where the fun starts!
