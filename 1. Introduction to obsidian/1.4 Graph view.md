# Graph view
One of the best parts of Obsidian is the **Graph view**, where you can see how your notes are linked and explore new connections.

(For other appearance customization, go back to: [[1.2 Appearance and core plugins]]).

#### Adding color to nodes
There a few ways to utilize the graph view for exploring connections. One of the first things you should do is adding colors to your groups of files, tags, or paths (depending on your set-up). You can do this by clicking on the graph icon on the left side ("Open graph view"), then opening settings. From there you can select paths or tags that you have made. Be sure to link each note together in a useful way!

#### Orphans
You will discover that some notes have not been linked. These are called orphan notes. You can view these by entering Graph view->settings(wheel icon)->Filters->checking the "orphans" option.

#### Jugglr
There is an optional community plug-in, Jugglr, that customizes the graph view even further. With this plug-in, you can add various shapes to the different nodes, freeze nodes while moving others, and add notes on top of your graph. Here is an example of how we are using Jugglr:

# Exercise 1.4
1. Open the graph view in this tutorial and locate the orphan note. How can you link it to another note so that it is no longer an orphan?
2. Add colors to your two connecting notes in the newly created vault. You can either use tags or your folder paths.
3. Change the repel force and link distance on the graph view (under the settings wheel -> Forces -> Repel force)
