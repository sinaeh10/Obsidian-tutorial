# Appearance and core plugins

#### Must-have settings
Let's customize the workspace a bit more! Click on the **settings** (wheel icon) on the bottom left and go into the "editor" menu first. Here, we recommend that you activate the following:
1. Spell check
2. Auto-pair brackets
3. Auto-pair Markdown Syntax

Now, go to "Files &Links" and activate the following:
1. Automatically update internal links -> this one is **important** to have. It updates your links in **all** notes automatically each time you change the link names.


#### Core plugins
Here, we recommend that you activate the following core plugins:

1.  Tag pane <- To have an overview of your tags inside the documents.
2.  Search <- To search within your documents.
3.  Graph view <- To utilize the graph feature. For additional graph settings, check out [[1.4 Graph view]]
4.  Backlinks <- This will show you the other end of the links from the document that has been linked, so that you don't need to link it back.
5.  Outgoing links <- This shows a list of destinations your note links to. It also gives a list of unlinked mentions from the current note that can be linked.
6.  Page preview <- You will have a preview of the page when hovering over the link
7.  Templates <- You will be able to create note templates
8.  Outline <- When you make headers with # they appear on the outline. Great for navigating!
9.  Word count <- For keeping track of words written.
10.  Zettelkasten prefixer <-To generate a Zettelkasten prefixer for random note-taking


#### Theme
Click on "Appearance" in the menu. Scroll down and find the browse option for "community themes". Here you can preview and install various themes (dark and light) if you prefer different colors for the background. Some are more *fun* than others, but be sure to pick something that enables you to write well (i.e. someting that makes you feel as comfortable with Obsidian as you would with a Word document).


#### Some other organization tips
You can add number bins and use the johnny decimal system for organizing folders and documents (the numbers bring the notes in order, as you cannot control the order in Obsidian currently). 
To read more about the Johnny decimal system, go here: https://johnnydecimal.com/

We break the rules a bit on this system, but we can recommend following a variation of it! It will force you to keep things organized. Here is an example:

Here is another example:

![[2.7 Johnny decimal-2.jpg|300]]

When you feel ready, head over to [[1.3 Community plugins and snippets]] to download customized community plugins. This is where the fun starts! You will be able to add a dictionary, pomodoro timer, calender, drawing tablets, and so on.

# Exercise 1.2
1. Create a new vault on Obsidian (by clicking on the can of tuna-icon -> Create). Compare the settings and themes. What is different from the tutorial vault?
2. Add two new notes to your new vault and link them together using Markdown code. Open graph view (graph icon on top left corner) to see if the notes have connected.
3. Create a new folder in your new vault and drag the notes into the folder.
4. Find a community theme for your new vault and activate the core settings.
