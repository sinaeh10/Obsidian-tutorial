# Introduction to Obsidian

#### Welcome to Obsidian!

Obsidian is a program where you can practice Zettelkasten note-taking. What do we mean by this? That you will be linking your notes together to remember old notes and discover new connections!  At a first sight, this might look overwhelming - don't worry, it will become easier and fun the more you use it!

**Some things to keep in mind:** 

1. You will always be writing in Markdown syntax when working in Obsidian. You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E (control+E in Windows?). *There are some things in this tutorial that you cannot see in edit mode, so make sure to switch to preview!*
2. You can open/create new vaults by clicking on the bottom left icon that looks like a vault door. At the very bottom, there is a wheel icon that takes you to the Obsidian settings.
3. You have a lot of freedom to make **your** obsidian workspace into what **you** need. We have already added a simple set-up to this vault to help you out, but a lot is missing - it is now up to you to add the rest! 
4. If you close your vault, or the program, your document is saved automatically (every 2 seconds) and locally onto your computer. You can simply navigate to the folder location for your vault and find the .md files generated. You can also choose to "control + save" if you prefer this.


**For each section of this tutorial, there will be a couple of exercises for you to practice using Obsidian.**

Please familiarize yourself with markdown syntax and note-linking by visiting [[1.2 Markdown Syntax]]!
Once you're ready for more customization, head over to [[1.3 Core plugins]].
