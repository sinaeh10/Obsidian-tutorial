# Introduction to Obsidian

#### Welcome to Obsidian!

Obsidian is a program where you can practice Zettelkasten note-taking. What do we mean by this? That you will be linking your notes together to remember old notes and discover new connections!  At a first sight, this might look overwhelming - don't worry, it will become easier and fun the more you use it!

**Some things to keep in mind:** 

1. You will always be writing in Markdown syntax when working in Obsidian You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 

2. You can open/create new vaults by clicking on one of the three bottom left icons that looks like a vault door. At the very bottom, there is a wheel icon that takes you to the Obsidian settings.

3. You have a lot of freedom to make **your** obsidian workspace into what **you** need. We have already added a simple design with a few plugins to this vault to help you out, but a lot is missing - it is now up to you to add the rest! 

4. Click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to close/open a local graph.  You can also permanently drag or remove the graph view or other features around, like you wish to.

- For each section of this tutorial, there will be a couple of exercises for you to practice using Obsidian.

**Examples of our workspaces:**

Once you're ready for more customization, head over to [[1.2 Markdown Syntax]].
