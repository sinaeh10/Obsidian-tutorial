# Introduction to Obsidian

- **Welcome to Obsidian!**  At a first sight, this might look overwhelming. But don't worry, it will become easier and fun the more you use it! 

Some things to keep in mind:
- You will always be writing in Markdown when working in Obsidian You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 

- You can open/create new vaults by clicking at the bottom left icon that looks like a can of tuna being opened (I guess it's meant to look like a vault door...). At the bottom left corner, there is a wheel that takes you to the settings.

- You have a lot of freedom to arrange and make the obsidian workspace into what you need. We have already added a simple design with a few plugins to this vault to help you out, but a lot is missing - it is now up to you to add the rest! Click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to close/open a local graph.  You can also permanently drag or remove the graph view or other features around, like you wish to. Click on the command palette icon on the left corner to search for any new plugins that you have downloaded.

- At the end of each section of this tutorial, there will be a couple of exercises for you to practice using Obsidian.

**Examples of our workspaces:**

Once you're ready for more customization, head over to [[1.2 Appearance and core plugins]].

## Figure codes

!\[\[figure-example\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note
!\[\[figure-example|300|left\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note, making the size 300 and left-aligning it

FYI: Figures will show up in edit mode if downloading the Ozan's images plugin
