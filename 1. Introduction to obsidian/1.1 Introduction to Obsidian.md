# Introduction to Obsidian

#### Welcome to Obsidian!

Obsidian is a program where you can practice Zettelkasten note-taking. What do we mean by this? That you will be linking your notes to each other and see a bigger picture! At a first sight, this might look overwhelming. But don't worry, it will become easier and fun the more you use it!

**Some things to keep in mind:** 
1. You will always be writing in Markdown syntax when working in Obsidian You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 

2. You can open/create new vaults by clicking at the bottom left icon that looks like a can of tuna being opened (I guess it's meant to look like a vault door...). At the bottom left corner, there is a wheel that takes you to the settings.

3. You have a lot of freedom to arrange and make the obsidian workspace into what you need. We have already added a simple design with a few plugins to this vault to help you out, but a lot is missing - it is now up to you to add the rest! 

4. Click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to close/open a local graph.  You can also permanently drag or remove the graph view or other features around, like you wish to. Click on the command palette icon on the left corner to search for any new plugins that you have downloaded.

- At the end of each section of this tutorial, there will be a couple of exercises for you to practice using Obsidian.

**Examples of our workspaces:**
