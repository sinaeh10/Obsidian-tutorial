# Markdown Syntax

First, let's become more familiar with Markdown syntax when taking notes in Obsidian:

[[]] <- this is how you create links that will show up on the graph view
#appearanceplugins  <- this is how you tag
[@citekey]  <- this is how you call a zotero citekey reference

**bold text**
*italicized text*

# This is a header
## Another header
### Yet another header
#### And another header

1. This is a list
2. Something else on the list
3. And something else?

- A bullet point list
- Etc.
- Etc.


A task list 
- [ ]  Task 1
- [X]  Task 2
- [ ]  Task 3


==This is how you highlight==


```
This is a space for typing code
```


> This is how you make a quote


## Figure codes

!\[\[figure-example\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note
!\[\[figure-example|300|left\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note, making the size 300 and left-aligning it

FYI: Figures will show up in edit mode if downloading the Ozan's images plugin
