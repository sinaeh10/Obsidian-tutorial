# Markdown Syntax

First, let's become more familiar with the Markdown syntax used when taking notes in Obsidian:

[[]] <- this is how you create links that will show up on the graph view
#appearanceplugins  <- this is how you tag
[@citekey]  <- this is how you call a Zotero citekey reference
[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) <- You can link websites, URLs and other files outside your vault with this format

You can also check how to embed videos, or websites on the **Obsidian Help** vault for more tips and tricks!

**bold text**
*italicized text*
__this is another bold format__
_this is another italicized text_
~~cross out text~~
==highlight text==

~~**==_you can combine them_==**~~

# This is a header
## Another header
### Yet another header
#### And another header

1. This is a list
2. Something else on the list
3. And something else?

- A bullet point list
- Etc.
- Etc.


A task list 
- [ ]  Task 1
- [X]  Task 2
- [ ]  Task 3


```
This is a space for typing code
```


> This is how you make a quote


## Figure codes

!\[\[figure-example\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note
!\[\[figure-example|300|left\]\] -> embedding a figure into a note, making the size 300 and left-aligning it
