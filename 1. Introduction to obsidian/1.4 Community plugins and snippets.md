# Community plugins
Every day, a new community plugin is added to Obsidian. Developers are constantly working on making new functions for the program. Here are some community plug-ins that we recommend for academic note-taking:

1. Checklist <- this plugin allows you to see your checklist while you are working on the document. Go to [[3.1 To-do list]] to see a checklist example.
2. Obsidian Advanced New file <- Allows you to choose a folder before creating the note. Go to hotkey settings to create a key for this feature.
3. Better word count <- for more word count details (for the sprints, of course)
4. Calendar <- if you want to connect your notes to a calendar
5. Ozan's Image in Editor plugin <- this will allow you to view images in markdown editor mode (so that you don't have to switch to preview for viewing)
6. Obsidian Dictionary <- this will recommend synonyms in your text
7. Sliding Panes <- Plugin for viewing multiple documents as panes
8. Advanced tables <- If you would like to make tables in your vault (to replace Excel, somewhat)
9. Activity history (or Daily Stats) <- For tracking your daily activity and work on Obsidian
10. Excalidraw <- For making drawings and embedding them into your notes. Great for visualizing figures for datasets and in drafts.
11. Pomodoro plugin <- A simple pomodoro clock for better productivity!
12. CSV Table <- Embed a CSV file as a table within a note
13. Citations <- this plugin is a must for working with Zotero. With this plugin, you can add in text citations to your notes and browse your zotero library. You can also add literature notes and annotations from Zotero. Head over to [[1.6 Zotero]] for more details on how to do this.
14. Pandoc plugin <- this plugin lets you convert your documents to Word format direction from Obsidian. The plugin is still under development, unfortunately, so a bibliography cannot yet be generated (We have a work-around for this, using Zettlr. For more on this, head over to [[1.7 Pandoc and Zettlr]]). However, we are confident that in a few months, this feature will also become available on Obsidian.


#### Installing community plugins
1. We have already made some settings changes, so you should be able to view community plugins menu. However, if you are starting a new vault, you will first need to **Disable safe mode**. You will get a warning message that you are about to turn off safe mode. Select "Turn off Safe Mode."
2. Click on **Browse** and search for the above community plugins.
3. Select install for the plugins that you wish to download. After the installation, select **Enable** or activate it under the list of community plugins. Now you should be able to use the plugin.
4. Some plugins have icons that are on your obsidian workspace, so that they are easier to find. Others only have hotkeys assigned to them. Browse all hotkeys by selecting the **Open command palette** icon in the left corner (it is found right below the graph view icon).

#### Snippets
If there are features that you do not like in a community theme, you can also add and customize your own snippet code.

Simply add a snippets folder to your .obsidian folder (this will be where your vault is located on the local storage). In this folder, you can add snippets for additional changes (such as font, text alignment, color, background, etc.). For example, you can add a snippet file to the snippets folder to change all text into being justified, instead of left aligned.

Snippet codes can be found at: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978

If you have added a snippet, be sure to activate the added snippets found in Settings->Appearance->CSS snippets
