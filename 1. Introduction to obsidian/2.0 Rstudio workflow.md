# Rstudio workflow 

If you are already using markdown in Rstudio (.rmd files), you can also add these files to your Obsidian vault. This allows you to push-pull both scripts and your notes simultaneously. Plus, if you are using Git in Rstudio also, you can push-pull your notes along with your scripts through Rstudio

#### Configuring Obsidian to read .rmd and .r files

Once you have set up markdown and git in R, you will need Obsidian to recognize R's version of markdown files ".rmd"

To do this, follow these steps:
1. Download and activate the community plugin **txt-as-md**
2. Go to **Obsidian settings->Community plugins menu -> click on the small folder icon on the right side of "Installed plugins."** This will take you to the folders holding the scripts that run our plugins. (Note: if you go directly to the folders instead of through settings, you will not be able to see the files).
3. Open the folder called "txt-as-md-obsidian" and locate the javascript file **"main.js"**
4. Open this file using a script editor, such as BBedit, RStudio, TextEdit, or something similar
5. Search for "this.registerExtensions" within the script. Here you will add "rmd" and "r" to the list, as seen in the image below:

6. Save the changes in the file and restart Obsidian. Next, you can try to insert a .rmd file created from Rstudio into the Obsidian vault. Obsidian should now recognize this file as a markdown file. 

This means that you can now combine your Rstudio workspace and scripts with your Obsidian vault, and push-pull all changes to Github either through obsidian or Rstudio. If you edit your .rmd files in Obsidian, these changes will also be seen in Rstudio, and vice versa. 

*Note: Obsidian's Graph view is currently not reading rmd and r files with tags properly. We will make an update as soon as this gets fixed!*
