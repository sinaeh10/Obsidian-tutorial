# Introduction to Obsidian

- **Welcome to Obsidian!**  At a first sight, this might look overwhelming. But don't worry, it will become easier and fun the more you use it! :)

Some things to keep in mind:
- You will always be working in markdown when writing in obsidian! You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 

- You can open/create new vaults by clicking at the bottom left icon that looks like a can of tuna being opened (I guess it's meant to look like a vault door... ![[Vault.png]]). At the bottom left corner, there is a wheel that takes you to the settings.

- You have a lot of freedom to arrange and make the obsidian workspace into what you need for work. We have already added a design to this vault to help you out, but this can be changed! Click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to close/open a local graph.  You can also permanently drag or remove the graph view or other features around, like you wish to.Click on the command palette icon on the left corner to search for any new plugins you have downloaded, to add permanently into view. 

- Examples of our set-ups:

Once you're ready for more customization, head over to [[2. Appearance and core plugins]].

# Markdown code cheat sheet

A few things to recognize and use when making notes in obsidian:

[[]] <- this is how you create links that will show up on the graph view
#hashtag <- this is how you tag
[@citekey]  <- this is how you call a zotero citekey reference

**bold text**
*italicized text*
_this is another italicized text_
__this is another bold text__

# This is a header
## Another header
### Yet another header
#### And another header

1. This is a list
2. Something else on the list
3. And something else?

- A bullet point list
- Etc.
- Etc.


A task list 
- [ ]  Task 1
- [X]  Task 2
- [ ]  Task 3
