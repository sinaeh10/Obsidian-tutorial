# Community plugins
Every day, a new community plugin is added to Obsidian. Developers are constantly working on making new functions for the program. Here are some community plug-ins that I recommend:

1. Checklist <- this plugin allows you to see your checklist while you are working on the document
2. Better word count <- for more word count details (for the sprints, of course)
3. Calendar <- if you want to connect your notes to a calendar
4. Ozan's Image in Editor plugin <- this will allow you to view images in markdown editor mode (so that you don't have to switch to preview for viewing)
5. Obsidian Dictionary <- this will recommend synonyms in your text
6. Pomodoro plugin <- A simple pomodoro clock for better productivity :)
7. Sliding Panes <- Nice plugin for multi-tasking in multiple documents
8. Advanced tables <- If you would like to make tables in your vault (to replace Excel, somewhat)
9. Citations <- this plugin is a must for working with Zotero. With this plugin, you can add in text citations to your notes and browse your zotero library. You can also add literature notes and annotations from Zotero. Head over to [[4. Zotero]] for more details on how to do this!
3. Pandoc plugin <- this plugin lets you convert your documents to Word format direction from Obsidian. The plugin is still under development, unfortunately, so a bibliography cannot yet be generated (Daniel and I have a work-around for this, using Zettlr. For more on this, head over to [[5. Pandoc and Zettlr]]). However, I am confident that in a few months, this feature will also be available.

# Snippets
If there are features that you do not like, you can also add and customize your own snippet code.

Simply add a snippets folder to your .obsidian folder (this will be where your vault is located on the local storage). In this folder, you can add snippets for additional changes (such as font, color, background, etc.). For example, I made my text justified, instead of left aligned by adding a snippet code to the folder for this.

Snippet codes can be found at: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978

Once you have added snippets, be sure to activate the added snippets found in Settings->Appearance->CSS snippets
