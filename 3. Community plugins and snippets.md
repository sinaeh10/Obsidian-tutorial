Citations


Things to still figure out:

How to push pull automatically
How to link annotations directly to obsidian without having to copy paste from zotero
How to coordinate zettlr and obsidian (and not letting zettlr adding changes to obsidian documents)




Some suggestions to obsidian users and for myself:
- Making a way for zettlr to not make edits on top of obsidian
- Adding a way to convert links into citekeys (if they are named @ and zotero citekey name already). Perhaps a simple "remove second bracket throughout document" function?. UPDATE: ask daniel, he had a fix for this
- How to make it so that notes and figures don't get added to the last zettelkasten folder 
-  Daniel says... the zotfile edits for the notes makes it so much smoother to export them to zotero without much edits.. Ask him to add this feature? but do i already do this? i have zotfile
