**Abstract:** Ecological genetics is increasingly recognized as critical to understanding interactions among organisms and ecosystem processes. Using a common garden with pure and hybrid cottonwood trees of known genotype, two years of field surveys, and a cafeteria feeding experiment, we link introgression of Fremont genetic markers, condensed tannins (a genetically based plant trait), and foraging by beavers. These data support two major arguments. First, hybridization is an important mechanism for the transmission of ecologically functional traits. Second, links between a genetically based plant trait in a dominant riparian-forest tree species and the foraging behavior of beavers, an ecosystem engineer, emphasize that genetically based plant traits can directly and indirectly link population, community, and ecosystem processes.

> "We assayed cottonwood bark tissues for these compounds and found that beaver preferences were negatively correlated with the concentration of condensed tannins (Fig. 2b)." ([Bailey et al 2004:606](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=4))

> "On average, beavers were 123 more likely to select a genotype without tannins than a genotype with 4% tannins by dry mass." ([Bailey et al 2004:606](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=4))

*Beavers select trees with lower amounts of condensed tannins. Cool :) [[Linked note example]] ([note on p.606](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=4))*


> "Overall, these data suggested that foraging patterns of beavers are influenced by condensed-tannin concentration in the bark tissue of cottonwoods" ([Bailey et al 2004:606](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=4))

*Beavers are influenced by tannin concentrations. [[Linked note example]] ([note on p.606](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=4))*



> "A growing body of literature indicates that many mammalian herbivores including beavers, opossum, hares, voles, and roe deer discriminate among plants that vary in secondary chemical composition (Edwards 1978, Bryant 1981, Basey et al. 1988, 1990, Pusenius et al. 2002, Verheyden-Tixier and Duncan 2000). Specifically, studies have shown that beaver preference for food resources can be influenced by plant secondary metabolites (Basey et al. 1988, 1990)" ([Bailey et al 2004:607](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=5))

*Other animals also select plants with lower PSMs (various types), in the case of this paper, itâ€™s tannins [[Linked note example]] ([note on p.607](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G877MT4V?page=5))*
