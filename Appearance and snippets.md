Customization
Theme plugins
Add a snippets folder to your .obsidian folder to make additional changes (font, color, background, etc.). Snippet code can be found at: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978


organization methods:
Number bins and johhny decimal system (with some exceptions :) )

Making a folder with articles and naming them as cite keys. They can be linked to concepts and papers and once converting the document in zettlr, the link turns into the reference (through the citekey system). Just have to delete a bracket though....
