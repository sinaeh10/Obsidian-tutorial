# Introduction to markdown

- **Welcome to Obsidian!**  Don't worry, it will become easier and more fun the more you use it! :)
- You will always be working in markdown when writing in obsidian! You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 
- You can open or create new vaults by clicking at the bottom left icon that looks like a can of tuna being opened (I guess it's meant to be a vault door). At the bottom, there is a wheel that takes you to settings.

- There is a lot of freedom to arrange and make the obsidian workspace into what you need for work.  You can click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to open a local graph. You can also permanently add or change the graph or other windows around, like you wish to. My current set-up looks like this (I have graph view, outline and links permanently open on the right side)

- Once you're ready for more customization, head over to [[2. Appearance and core plugins]].

1. This is a list
2. Something else on the list

A task list
