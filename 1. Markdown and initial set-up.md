# Introduction to markdown

- You will work in markdown when writing in obsidian! You are currently in "edit mode" and can switch to "preview mode" either by clicking the small note icon on the top right corner of this document (to the left of the X) or by using command+E. 

- You can click on the three dots on the top right of this document to split the view, or to open a locan graph. You can also permanently add or change the views around, like you wish to. My current set-up looks like this (I have graph view, outline and links permanently open on the right side)
