Add a snippets folder to your .obsidian folder to make additional changes (font, color, background, etc.). Snippet code can be found at: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-common-css-hacks/1978

Things to still figure out:

How to push pull automatically
How to link annotations directly to obsidian without having to copy paste from zotero
How to coordinate zettlr and obsidian (and not letting zettlr adding changes to obsidian documents)


organization methods:
Number bins and johhny decimal system (with some exceptions :) )

Making a folder with articles and naming them as cite keys. They can be linked to concepts and papers and once converting the document in zettlr, the link turns into the reference (through the citekey system). Just have to delete a bracket though....



Some suggestions to obsidian users and for myself:
- Making a way for zettlr to not make edits on top of obsidian
- Adding a way to convert links into citekeys (if they are named @ and zotero citekey name already). Perhaps a simple "remove second bracket throughout document" function?. UPDATE: ask daniel, he had a fix for this
- How to make it so that notes and figures don't get added to the last zettelkasten folder 
-  Daniel says... the zotfile edits for the notes makes it so much smoother to export them to zotero without much edits.. Ask him to add this feature? but do i already do this? i have zotfile
