# Appearance and core plugins

#### Must-have settings
Let's customize the workspace a bit more! Head over to **settings** (wheel icon on bottom left) and find the "editor" menu first. Here, I recommend that you activate the following:
1. Spell check

Now, go to "Files &Links" and activate the following
1. Automatically update internal links -> this one is **important** to have. It updates your links in all documents each time you change their names.


#### Core plugins
Here, we recommend that you activate the following plugins:

1.  Tag pane
2.  Search
3.  Graph view
4.  Backlinks (this will show you the other end of the links from the document that has been linked, so that you don't need to link it back)
5.  Outgoing links (this shows a list of destinations your note links to. It also gives a list of unlinked mentions from the current note that can be linked.)
6.  Page preview (you will have a preview of the page when hovering over the link)
7.  Templates (you can create note templates)
8.  Outline (When you make headers with # they appear on the outline. great for navigating!)
9.  Word count (for our sprints ;) )


#### Theme
Click on "Appearance" in the menu. Scroll down and find the browse option for "community themes". Here you can preview and install various themes (dark and light) if you prefer different colors for the background. Some are more *fun* than others! But just be sure to pick something that enables you to write and see the text well, so that you will feel as comfortable with Obsidian as with Word.


#### Some other organization tips
You can add number bins and use the johnny decimal system for organizing folders and documents (the numbers bring the notes in order, as you cannot control the order in Obsidian currently). To read more about the Johnny decimal system, go here: https://johnnydecimal.com/
We break the rules a bit on this, but I can recommend following a variation of it! It will force you to keep things organized. Here is an example of Lotte's:

When you feel ready, head over to [[3. Community plugins and snippets]] for downloading customized community plugins! This is where the fun starts! You will be able to add a dictionary, pomodoro timer, calender, todo-tasks, and so on.
