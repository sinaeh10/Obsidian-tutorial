# Zotero

Zotero is an open source reference manager (similar to Mendeley). 

#### 1. Add-ons needed for Zotero:
You will need some additional add-ons in Zotoro. In Zotero, go to Tools->Add-ons->Install Add-ons from file. Here you will add:
1. Better BibTex for Zotero -> For citing in LaTex and generating citekeys. Found here: https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/
2. Mdnotes -> Converts annotations to markdown code that you can export to Obsidian. Found here: https://github.com/argenos/zotero-mdnotes
3. Zotfile -> For extracting annotations and managing PDFs from browser. Found here: http://zotfile.com/

#### 2. Add-ons needed for Obsidian
You will also need to install the citations plugin on Obsidian ([[3. Community plugins and snippets]])
1. Citations <- With this plugin, you can add in text citations to your notes and browse your zotero library. 
2. Pandoc plugin <- This plugin lets you convert your documents to Word format direction from Obsidian.

#### 3. Additional add-ons
We recommend that you install a Zotero add-on on your browser (either chrome, firefox, or brave) so that you can add references and PDFs directly from browser->Zotero.

#### 4. Connecting Zotero with Obsidian
You will need to save the .bib file inside your vault so that Obsidian can retrieve the references:
1. Right click on your library folder -> Export library (and check the "Keep updated").
2. Once you have exported the .bib file, copy its path name.
3. Open Obsidian and go to the Citations plugin settings. Select BibLaTex under Citation database format and copy-paste the .bib path under Citation database path.
4. Test this by opening a new note and entering control + N. You should now be able to browse your references inside Obsidian.

#### 5. Stylizing the literature note
Go back to the Citations plugin settings and locate the literature note. Here you can make a literature note template for retrieving article information that you find important. My template looks like this:

```
# Literature note:
---
**Title:** {{title}}
**Authors:** {{authorString}}
**Type:** Enter article type (opinion, review, original research)
**Year:** {{year}}
**URI reference in Zotero:** {{zoteroSelectURI}}
**Abstract:** {{abstract}}
**Citekey:** {{citekey}}
**Chapters used in:** [[]]
```

#### 6. Extracting annotations from Zotero to Obsidian



#### 7. Converting cite keys into in-text citations

#### 8. Converting links into in-text citations using Zettlr
When making links in Obsidian, we use [[]]. And when citing in-text, we use [@citekey]. Therefore, you can combine these two features by writing [[@citekey]], thereby making a link that refers to a note where your annotations are. Then, once removing the second bracking and converting the document, this note will turn into an in-text citation.
