This is an exercise for [[1.2 Markdown Syntax]]

1. Add a new note to this vault and call it Note 1. Locate the new note - where is it?

3. Go to preview and double-click on the newly made link in Note 2. Where does it take you?
4. Go back to "Note 2" and refer to an non-existent "Note 3" using Markdown syntax.
5. Go to preview and double-click on the newly made link. Where does it take you? What is different about this note?
6. Open graph view (graph icon on top left corner) to see if the three notes are connected.
