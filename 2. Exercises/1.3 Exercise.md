This is an exercise for [[1.3 Core plugins]]

2. Create a new note and locate the "Insert template" on the left side. Select a template and see what happens.
3. Go back to Note 1 and add a tag called #notes. Repeat this tag for Note 2 and Note 3. Then open the tag pane (tag icon on top right, next to backlinks). Which other tags do you see?
