# Exercise 1.3 - Appearance and core plugins

This is an exercise for [[1.3 Appearance and core plugins]]

1. Now that you have activated the core plugin *Backlinks*, go back to "Note 1" and take a look at the backlinks (chain icon on the top right). Can you see which notes are referring to "Note 1"?
2. Create a new note and locate the "Insert template" on the left side. Select a template and see what happens.
3. Go back to Note 1 and add a tag called #notes. Repeat this tage for Note 2 and Note 3. Then open the tag pane (tag icon on top right, next to backlinks). Which other tags do you see?
7. Create a new vault on Obsidian (by clicking on the tuna-can-icon -> Create) and find a community theme for your new vault. Compare the settings and themes. What is different from the tutorial vault?
